# Commodity Price Prediction

Welcome to the **Commodity Price Prediction** project! This initiative aims to forecast commodity prices using advanced machine learning techniques. The project encompasses data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation of results.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Actual.csv**: Contains the actual commodity price data for validation against model predictions.
- **Data_collection.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook for collecting and preprocessing commodity price data from various sources.
- **EDA.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook dedicated to exploratory data analysis, helping to visualize trends and patterns in the dataset.
- **ML_model_results.csv**: A CSV file that captures the performance metrics and results of the machine learning models.
- **create_model.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that guides you through the process of creating and training machine learning models.
- **df.csv** & **df1.csv**: Processed datasets utilized for training and evaluating the models.
- **predictions/**: A directory that contains output predictions generated by the trained models.

## Features

This project includes several key features:

- **Data Collection**: Automated scripts to gather and preprocess commodity price data from external sources.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical analyses to uncover insights and trends within the dataset.
- **Machine Learning Model Development**: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms for price prediction.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics and visualizations to assess model performance.

## Prerequisites

To successfully run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: 
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`

You can find all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshgupta1810/commodity_price_prediction.git
   cd commodity_price_prediction
   ```

2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To utilize this project, follow these steps:

1. Start with **Data_collection.ipynb** to gather and preprocess the necessary data.
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis using **EDA.ipynb** to understand your dataset better.
3. Train your machine learning model by executing **create_model.ipynb**.
4. Validate your predictions against actual prices found in **Actual.csv**, and review model performance in **ML_model_results.csv**.

## Results

- The outcomes of the trained models are documented in **ML_model_results.csv**, providing insights into their effectiveness.
- Generated predictions can be accessed in the **predictions/** directory.
